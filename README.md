# Credit Card Form
This is a web-based form built with React that allows users to input their credit card information and create a new card. The form includes validation for the card number, name, expiration date, and CVV code.

# LIVE DEMO

Look the live version in Vercel https://card-creator-swart.vercel.app

# Usage
To use the credit card form, simply enter your credit card information into the corresponding input fields. The form includes the following fields:

Card number: a 16-digit credit card number, with validation for proper formatting and length
Name: the cardholder's name, with validation for required input and alphabetical characters only
Expiration date: the month and year of the card's expiration, with validation for proper formatting and future dates only
CVV: the 3-digit code on the back of the card, with validation for proper formatting and length
Once all fields have been successfully validated, the "Create Card" button will become enabled. Click this button to submit the form and create a new card.

# Validation
The form includes validation for each input field to ensure that only valid credit card information is submitted. If any field fails validation, the user will see an error message and the "Create Card" button will be disabled.

Validation is performed in real-time as the user inputs information, and error messages will appear immediately when a field fails validation.
